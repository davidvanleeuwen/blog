### About this blog ###

I've always loved to read blogs, hackernews and such, but I always struggeled finding the right information. 

This blog is an early [prototype](https://github.com/davidvanleeuwen/blog) and an experiment.

My goal is to post articles about all kinds of JavaScript goodness, like a book with in-depth tutorials. With every tutorial this blog will become more of a JavaScript application and that code will be put to practice, so you can follow the progress for real.

If you know Javascript, but are new to JavaScript applications - you'll find everything here about how to build complex JavaScript applications. If you're a JavaScript novice, you might find useful tips and tricks, or you can fork my blog to help get the right information out there.

PS: I'm no native English speaker, so everyone who the mood to do some copywriting is welcome.
