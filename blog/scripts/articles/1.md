Build a blog using Grunt
--------

This blog is an early prototype and an experiment. My goal is to post a series of articles about all kinds of JavaScript goodness. With every article I'll improve this blog and explain how I did it. This time, I'll get into Grunt, because I use it as a base for all my projects.

**Just a little sidenote**: If you're a JavaScript beginner - you'll find everything here about how to build complex JavaScript applications. If you're a JavaScript novice, you might find usefull tips and tricks or you can pull request my blog to help get the right information out there.

### How to get started? ###

You don't need to read everything. You can just head over my Github and clone the thing and run your own blog.
