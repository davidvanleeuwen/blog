Useful Backbone extensions
--------

Backbone 1.0.0 was recently released. In this article we'll talk about why Backbone has become such a great platform. You probably already know Backbone and know why it's awesome, but the extensions make it even more spectacular. [See how this code works](https://github.com/davidvanleeuwen/blog).

### The awesomesauce ###

Backbone is a library and you can use it however you want. When you're working on more complex apps, you'll run into certain problems or want to give a user a better experience. 

Last week I talked about Marionette, which is an extensions that adds functionality so you can write your app faster/better. The past couple of months I've came across several extensions, which I think can make your life as a Backbone developer so much easier. That's why I've created a top 5 for you.

### 5. Paginator ###

We're not using the [Backbone.Paginator](https://github.com/addyosmani/backbone.paginator) for this blog, but it's really useful when creating an app that is in need of pagination. There are several paginator extensions out there, but this will get the job done.

It has two components, one meant for clientside pagination and one meant for pagination hooked up to your API. It extends from a `Backbone.Collection` and you can add your own options for serverside handling and UI handling. But you'll have to implement your own UI for pagination, which makes it more flexible - but requires some more coding on your end.

### 4. Validation ###

For most applications you'll need to do some validation. Not for this blog, but whenever you want to validate your form and do some UI work with it, you should definitely look at [Backbone.Validation](https://github.com/thedersen/backbone.validation). It's a simple and effective extension.

This extension is especially useful in combination with other extensions in this list.

### 3. RivetJS ###


### 2. Relational model ###
