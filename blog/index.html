I have had a classic case of FOMO for most of my life; much of which has been the cause of many an hour of being grounded as a kid.</p><p>My Fear Of Missing Out kept me out late, got me drunk, helped me evade the police and even got me a chance to kiss the girl of my dreams (and I was even awake!)</p><p>But, like any disease, over time it became the monster that I had to feed. I<em>had</em>to go out. I<em>couldn't</em>miss that party. If I stayed for just<em>one more drink</em>the sucky-ass night would become wonderful.</p><p>I was a slave to my FOMO. And, FOMO is a bitch of a master.</p><p>I had to figure out how to conquer it. There is no FOMO-Anonymous. No Jenny Craig for FOMO. In fact, by definition, to cure FOMO, you have to do it alone. It has to be about you.</p><p>And if FOMO was about a fear of not doing something, then the only way to face that fear was to just not do something.</p><p>To master the art of doing nothing.</p><p>Doing nothing is the antithesis of the American Way. We are doers! Fuck Yeah 'Murica!</p><p>As an entrepreneur it's even worse. We not only do â€” We do<em>all</em>of the time. Fuck Yeah Changin' the World!</p><p>Yet, as i started to explore the Optimization of Self, it became clear that success doesn't come from doing more and more, faster and faster, but actually from doing less.</p><p>Maybe Tim Ferriss is right. Maybe four hours is enough. Maybe.</p></article></body></html>
