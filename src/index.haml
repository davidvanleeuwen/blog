      %h2 Using Backbone Marionette

      %p As my phone likes to do, it was all abuzz with tweets and what not about folks enjoying SXSW.
      %p The vibration of my phone has always been unwelcome during a large event that I wasn't part of. I have had a classic case of FOMO for most of my life; much of which has been the cause of many an hour of being grounded as a kid.
      %p My Fear Of Missing Out kept me out late, got me drunk, helped me evade the police and even got me a chance to kiss the girl of my dreams (and I was even awake!)
      %p
        But, like any disease, over time it became the monster that I had to feed. I
        %em had
        to go out. I
        %em couldn't
        miss that party. If I stayed for just
        %em one more drink
        the sucky-ass night would become wonderful.
      %p I was a slave to my FOMO. And, FOMO is a bitch of a master.
      %p I had to figure out how to conquer it. There is no FOMO-Anonymous. No Jenny Craig for FOMO. In fact, by definition, to cure FOMO, you have to do it alone. It has to be about you.
      %p And if FOMO was about a fear of not doing something, then the only way to face that fear was to just not do something.
      %p To master the art of doing nothing.
      %p Doing nothing is the antithesis of the American Way. We are doers! Fuck Yeah 'Murica!
      %p
        As an entrepreneur it's even worse. We not only do â€” We do
        %em all
        of the time. Fuck Yeah Changin' the World!
      %p Yet, as i started to explore the Optimization of Self, it became clear that success doesn't come from doing more and more, faster and faster, but actually from doing less.
      %p Maybe Tim Ferriss is right. Maybe four hours is enough. Maybe.
